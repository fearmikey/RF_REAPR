# RF-REAPR - Guidelines for AI Agents & Developers

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS

### 1. STRICT 100% FOSS POLICY (F-DROID COMPLIANCE)
- **Zero Proprietary SDKs**: RF-REAPR is strictly Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), targeted for distribution on F-Droid and other open-source Android repositories.
- **FORBIDDEN DEPENDENCIES**:
  - NO Google Play Services (`com.google.android.gms:*`, including `play-services-location`)
  - NO Google Mobile Ads / AdMob (`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads`)
  - NO Google Play Billing (`com.android.billingclient:*`)
  - NO ML Kit or closed-source vision/speech SDKs (`com.google.mlkit:*`)
  - NO Firebase SDKs that pull in non-free binaries or Play Services requirements
  - NO Analytics, tracking, or proprietary telemetry libraries
- **ALLOWED DEPENDENCIES**:
  - Android Jetpack libraries (`androidx.*`)
  - Kotlin standard / coroutines / serialization libraries
  - Open-source third-party dependencies with permissive/copyleft FOSS licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD, GPL, MPL)
  - Standard Android framework APIs (e.g., `LocationManager` via `android.location.*`)
- **NO PRODUCT FLAVORS FOR PROPRIETARY PLUGINS**: Do not add product flavor dimensions or build variants that rely on non-free or Google Play-specific dependencies.

### 2. PRIVACY & OFFLINE FIRST
- The application must remain fully functional offline.
- All user data (security project records, evidence photo captures, PCAP network captures, audit checklists, scan logs) must stay local on device or be exportable via user-initiated standard formats.

## RELEASE & PUBLISHING WORKFLOW (F-DROID)

### AUTOMATED F-DROID UPDATES
The app is published on F-Droid with Reproducible Builds enabled and auto-update tracking via Git tags. When helping the user create a new release, agents MUST follow this exact workflow to ensure F-Droid successfully picks up the update:

1. **Bump Versions**: Update `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
2. **Reproducible Build Configuration**: Ensure `vcsInfo { include = false }` is present in `app/build.gradle.kts` under `buildTypes.release`. This prevents AGP from embedding local Git commit metadata in `META-INF/version-control-info.textproto`, which breaks F-Droid reproducible build verification.
3. **Fastlane Changelog**: Create a new text file at `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` containing concise release notes.
4. **Standard Changelog & Readme**: Update the main `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed bullet points under `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and update the version badge in `README.md`.
5. **F-Droid Metadata Recipe**: Update `fdroid/com.fearmikey.rf_reapr.yml`:
   - Update `versionName` and `versionCode`.
   - Update `commit` with the full 40-character Git commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
   - Ensure `gradle:` is set to `- yes`.
6. **Commit & Tag**: Commit all changes, create a git tag strictly following the `vX.Y.Z` format (e.g., `v1.5.3`), and push both the commit and the tag to GitHub.
7. **Reproducible Build Binary**: F-Droid requires the compiled APK to verify reproducible builds. Instruct the user to:
   - Build the signed release APK (`app-release.apk`) using their secure `rf_reapr.jks` keystore.
   - Go to GitHub Releases, draft a new release for the newly pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag.
   - Upload the `app-release.apk` file (F-Droid is hardcoded to look for this exact filename at `https://github.com/fearmikey/RF_REAPR/releases/download/v%v/app-release.apk`).
